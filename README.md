# Deploying a Flask API

This is the project starter repo for the course Server Deployment, Containerization, and Testing.

In this project you will containerize and deploy a Flask API to a Kubernetes cluster using Docker, AWS EKS, CodePipeline, and CodeBuild.

The Flask app that will be used for this project consists of a simple API with three endpoints:

- `GET '/'`: This is a simple health check, which returns the response 'Healthy'. 
- `POST '/auth'`: This takes a email and password as json arguments and returns a JWT based on a custom secret.
- `GET '/contents'`: This requires a valid JWT, and returns the un-encrpyted contents of that token. 

The app relies on a secret set as the environment variable `JWT_SECRET` to produce a JWT. The built-in Flask server is adequate for local development, but not production, so you will be using the production-ready [Gunicorn](https://gunicorn.org/) server when deploying the app.

## Initial setup
1. Fork this project to your Github account.
2. Locally clone your forked version to begin working on the project.

## Dependencies

- Docker Engine
    - Installation instructions for all OSes can be found [here](https://docs.docker.com/install/).
    - For Mac users, if you have no previous Docker Toolbox installation, you can install Docker Desktop for Mac. If you already have a Docker Toolbox installation, please read [this](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/docker-toolbox/) before installing.
 - AWS Account
     - You can create an AWS account by signing up [here](https://aws.amazon.com/#).
     

#### Virtual Environment

We recommend working within a virtual environment whenever using Python for projects. This keeps your dependencies for each project separate and organized. Instructions for setting up a virtual environment for your platform can be found in the [python docs](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

#### PIP Dependencies

Once you have your virtual environment setup and running, install dependencies by naviging to the `/backend` directory and running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Project Steps

$ export LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
$ echo $LOG_LEVEL
$ export JWT_SECRET='myjwtsecret'
// set log level to INFO for production

export TOKEN=`curl --data '{"email":"abc@xyz.com","password":"mypwd"}' --header "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST localhost:8080/auth  | jq -r '.token'`

curl --request GET 'http://localhost:8080/contents' -H "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}" | jq .

# Testing Locally
Calls the endpoint 'localhost:80/auth' with the email/password as the message body. 
The return JWT token assigned to the environment variable 'TOKEN' 
$ export TOKEN=`curl --data '{"email":"abc@xyz.com","password":"WindowsPwd"}' --header "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST localhost:80/auth  | jq -r '.token'`
$ echo $TOKEN
Decrypt the token and returns its content
$ curl --request GET 'http://localhost:80/contents' -H "Authorization: Bearer ${TOKEN}" | jq .

To inspect the files in the container:
$ docker exec -it <container id> bash
Completing the project involves several steps:

1. Write a Dockerfile for a simple Flask API
2. Build and test the container locally
3. Create an EKS cluster
4. Store a secret using AWS Parameter Store
5. Create a CodePipeline pipeline triggered by GitHub checkins
6. Create a CodeBuild stage which will build, test, and deploy your code

For more detail about each of these steps, see the project lesson.
